## Analyze A/B Test Results
This project was completed as part of the course requirements of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree certification.

### Overview
The project conducted A/B testing of user conversions on an old and new wepage.

Steps included hypothesis testing via bootstrapping and standard statistical tests,logistic regression and multiple regression modelling.

### Statistical Analysis
Bootstrapping sampling distributions and p-value calculations Z tests Logistic regression Multiple linear regression modelling to assess for interactions of independent variables

### Technologies Used
Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, StatsModels, Scipy LaTex Jupyter Notebook

### Key Findings
There is no significant evidence that new version of the page would result in more convertions when compared to the old page. The country of the user did not have any impact on the rate of conversion between the new and old page.
